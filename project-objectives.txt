    A. Fixed layouts are always the same, no matter what. Fluid layouts will
        shrink until it overlaps. Adaptive layouts allows the content to fit
        the screen better using media queries by snapping. Responsive layouts
        combines fixed, fluid, and adaptive together for a better experience.

2. Implement media queries in a project

3. Describe how using scalable units for font sizes impacts accessibility and
    why designing accessible web pages is important
    A. Designing accessible web pages is important because someone who is blind
        needs a screen reader and someone who needs larger text can still view the
        site. Using scalable units for font sizes impacts accessibility because
        it can allow browsers that are setup for larger text or smaller text have
        a better chance of being seen by the person viewing it.
